# Group12-SOEN341_Project_F24
### SOEN 341 Software Process - Team Project Fall 2024 
### A Peer Assessment Application

#### Project Description
This project introduces students to hands-on software development using Agile Scrum methodology. Over a 10-week period, participants will go through four sprints to develop a middle-fidelity prototype, following GitHub for version control and project management. The project focuses on creating a Peer Assessment System for university team projects, allowing students to evaluate their peers based on cooperation, conceptual and practical contributions, and work ethic. The system supports both students and instructors, promoting accountability through anonymous evaluations, score sharing, and an instructor dashboard. The project emphasizes innovation and encourages teams to explore additional users and features.

#### Key Points:
- Project Duration: 10 weeks, divided into 4 Agile Scrum sprints
Objective: Develop a middle-fidelity prototype of a Peer Assessment System
- Users: Students and instructors

#### Features:
- Anonymous student peer evaluation on four dimensions (cooperation, conceptual and practical contributions, work ethic)
- Automated score aggregation and anonymous feedback sharing
- Instructor dashboard for creating teams, viewing peer assessment results, and exporting data

### Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and setting up a React application using npm.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js: React requires Node.js to be installed. You can download it from Node.js Official Website.
npm: npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js. To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands:

Installation Steps
1. Create a React Application
The easiest way to create a new React application is by using create-react-app, a tool that sets up the project with all necessary configurations.

Using npx (Recommended)
If you're using npm 5.2 or later, you can use npx to create a React app without needing to install create-react-app globally:

Replace my-react-app with your desired project name.

Using npm
If you want to install create-react-app globally, use:

Key Files:

public/index.html: The main HTML file for your React app.
src/index.js: Entry point of your application.
src/App.js: Main component of your app.

Troubleshooting:

If you encounter permission issues, try using sudo (Linux/macOS) or running your terminal as an administrator (Windows).
If you receive any warnings/errors, consider deleting the node_modules folder and running npm install again.
